Welcome to the Web page of the MOSARCH project that focuses on automated **software architecture recovery/reconstruction (SAR)**. Software architecture documentation is important for program comprehension, developer communication and proper system maintenance. Unfortunately, this documentation is usually incorrect or incomplete, especially for legacy systems. Reverse engineering the documentation requires extensive effort as the software size and complexity increase. This project aims at developing **a generic, scalable and integrated SAR platform** that can employ **both exact optimization mehtods and heuristics** to utilize **various types of module interdependency data** based on **multi-objective optimization criteria**.
