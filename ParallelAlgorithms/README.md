## Parallel Algorithms

This is the repository for parallelization of algorithms previously proposed and published.

- All the necessary parameters are provided in [PHYGARMain.py], and all the variable names are self-explanatory.
- In order to enable initial greedy clustering heuristic to provide the number of clusters to the algorithms, set [runInitialHeuristic] = True. Otherwise, provide the number of cluster(s) manually by setting [runInitialHeuristic] = False.
